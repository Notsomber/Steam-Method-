## How It Works

This method involves injecting Lua scripts into your Steam client to "unlock" a game temporarily. Here's how it works:

1. The game data is unlocked locally and stored in your files, allowing you to play it as long as the script is running.
2. When playing the game, Steam will display that you're playing "Spacewarp."
3. The unlocked game **does not stay on your account** but remains accessible in your local files.
