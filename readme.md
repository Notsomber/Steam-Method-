Steam Method - Free to the Public
Introduction

This method is being made available to everyone for free. While many people would attempt to sell this method for profit, I firmly believe that they do not deserve to benefit from it. Instead, I’ve chosen to share this openly with the community.

    Disclaimer: This method is provided for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for how you use this information. Use it at your own risk.

How It Works

This method involves injecting your Steam client with Lua scripts to "unlock" a game temporarily. Here's how it works:

    The game data is unlocked and stored in your files, allowing you to play the game as long as the script is running.
    When running the game, Steam will display that you're playing "Spacewarp."
    The game does not stay permanently unlocked on your account, but it remains accessible on your local files.

Why Make This Public?

    Most people would sell this method for a profit. That’s not fair.
    I believe knowledge like this should be shared freely, not exploited for monetary gain.

Legal & Ethical Note

While this method might sound appealing, it may violate the Steam Subscriber Agreement and could lead to consequences such as account bans or legal actions. Always consider the risks and act responsibly.
