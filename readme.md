# Free Steam Method - "Spacewarp"

## Introduction

This method is being shared completely **free**. Most people would charge money for something like this, but they do not deserve to profit from it. Instead, I’ve decided to make this public for everyone.

## How It Works

This method uses Lua script injection to "unlock" a game temporarily. Here’s what happens:

1. Inject your Steam client with the provided Lua scripts.
2. The game will be unlocked locally in your files, allowing you to play it as long as the script is running.
3. When playing the game, Steam will display that you're playing "Spacewarp."
4. The unlocked game **does not stay on your account** but remains accessible in your local files.

## Why Is This Free?
